# Introduction

Howdy, 

You may be wondering what exactly this project is or more importantly what it has to do with anything in my life. Today in this ReadME we're going to go through what exactly this project is, why it was made, the statistics behind mental health in the United Kingdom, and how this project relates strongly to my life and projects. 

I can't wait to take this little journey with you. So sit back, relax, and read along. 

## Getting Started

Obviously before delving into the story behind this project you'd like to try out the script for yourself. First of all the most basic requirement is a working version of Python 3 and some sort of Windows 10 version for tkinter. 

To install tkinter simply run the command `pip3 install tk` 

Using the console cd yourself through version, 4, then run `python3 -m Diary.py`. 

*Note that if you get an error using version 4 like this:* 

> File "Diary.py", line 22, in descriptionInputHandler
>    labelText = str('mood = ' + mood + '. Description = ' + desc)
>TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "StringVar") to str

*Please use version 3. I'm actively trying to fix this bug but it seems to only be in version 4.* 

## Statistics & An explination 

A large part of making this software was due to the on-going mental health crisis. In the United Kingdom 1/4 people will experience some form of mental health problem. 

Me being a child and making this software in a large way was down to experiences I've had in my life and wanting them to stop for everyone else, in some way I thought this simple Python script could be apart of something much larger, and in many ways with Gamify it now will be. Truly though this crisis won't end until we're funded by the government and the government starts taking this crisis more seriously. 

## Why this project? 

This is going to be a little more confusing than the other paragraphs so far as this question can be interprited so many ways. 

My answer for now will relate to why I'm uploading it nearly two years on, not for sympathy, not to impress a potential employer, simply because now with Gamify becoming a success even early on in the project among a few hundred people I feel as though it's important for me to stay humble and remember why I'm still here doing Gamify.
